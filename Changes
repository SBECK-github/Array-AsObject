Any suggestions, bug reports, or donations :-) should be sent to me.

This module was originally distributed as Set::ArrayAlt, but was
renamed to Array::AsObject .

1.00  2009-04-14
  - Original release (as Set::ArrayAlt)
  - Originally, all functionality was in Template::Plugins::ListOps.
    Moved it here and made that module a wrapper around this one
    so the list operations can be used outside of templates.

1.01  2010-02-05
  - When a new object is created, it starts as an empty list instead
    of an undefined value.
  - Any type of element (scalar, reference, undef) can be stored in
    the list.
  - Added is_subset/not_subset methods.

1.02  2010-02-25
  - Renamed the module to Array::AsObject at the suggestion of the
    perl module list maintainers. The module was released under both
    names, so 1.02 is both the final version of Set::ArrayAlt and
    the initial release of Array::AsObject.

1.03
  - Changed HISTORY file to new Changes specification.
